# health-insurance-analysis

## Description
Utilizing Python, I'll be gathering data from the US Census Bureau API concerning the amount of people insured/uninsured from the year 2020, and poverty levels from 2020 to illustrate a possible correlation between poverty levels and the number of uninsured people per state. I will use Plotly as the visualization tool to create choropleth maps, allowing for a clear and interactive representation of the data. This analysis aims to uncover any potential relationship between poverty rates and the lack of health insurance coverage across different states in the United States.

## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Once the requirments are installed you may run the primary file through the command line to showcase the visualizations as such.
NOTE: Currently I only graphed the percentage of people per state uninsured.

```
python3 -m visualization.poverty_insurance_analysis
```
